from
SHANA Networks

To: Apollo Business Consulting
First and foremost, thank you for providing the SHANA team with the opportunity to bid on your upcoming network design project. The growth your company has seen over its lifetime has been remarkable and we're sure this relocation project will be the first step into the next 15 years of growth for Apollo Business Consulting.  

The team here at SHANA shares your commitment to excellence; and we believe we can provide you with a fast, robust, and expandable network that will support your growth for years to come. Our networks make use of state of the art hardware and we always design and install on site with expansion in mind. We recognize your innovative vision and believe our design will act as the backbone that your company can always rely on.

I'd like to take a moment to introduce our highly-skilled team of specialists:
1) Antonio Giacchetti
	- Coordination & Design
2) Adam Lo Giudice
	- Layout & Logistics
3) Henry Oyewole
	- Implementation & Security
4) Neil Power
	- Cabling & Network Media
5) Scott Richards
	- Hardware Specification & Installation

This design will serve 11 departments in your new 5 floor office complex and will provide access to the totality of your 311 employee workforce with room for expansion.

Specific hardware models may change as change as the project develops but our team has combed over the floorplans and have determined a preliminary set of the following hardware will be required:
- At least 1x core switch
- At least 2x distribution switches
- At least 10x access level switches
- Significant Lengths of Twisted Pair and Fibre Cabling
- Risers for horizontal cable runs
- Optional AP array to provide wireless coverage

Page 8: mention that the department on multiple floors are given independent access switches in order to be TIA/EIA compliant (no horizontal cable travel vertically)

In general, the more we can mention TIA/EIA complaince the better in my opinion

-No mention of overall bandwidth estimates (in "LogicalLayoutDocument.docx")
-Should mention that the WLC/LAPs are optional addition

Page 11: -The TR stands for telecommunication rooms
	-the firewall "f1" should be capitalized to "F1"
	-Explain why we put D1/D2 in TR2A/TR2B (minimize fibre connections, cheaper, less likely to have damage)

-Mention that all horizontal cabling is less than 90m (TIA/EIA compliant)

-The pictures in "PhysicalLayoutDocument.docx" are a bit easier to read when you zoom in

Page 27: Mention that the required max internet is ~277 Mb/s, so our firewall can more than handle it. 
***Mention this would accomodate working from home using VPNs***
We never really talked about it but mentioning Work from home would be a great thing to discuss more



Page 28: Should mention which specific uplink we will use from D1/D2 to C1 (probably 24 Gb/s). Also mention that each "Trunk" would require ~12.6 Gb/s uplink


Page 29: Mention that the max uplink required for access switches is ~3.3 Gb/s, so our Access switches can handle employee bandwidth


For the physical layout, it should probably be mentioned which specific access switch each dept has (larger ones have 48 port, etc)

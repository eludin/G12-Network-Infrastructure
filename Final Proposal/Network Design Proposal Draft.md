###### Table of Contents
- Section ....... Page Num

###### Introduction
- Intro will thank the business for the opportunity and acknowledge several key points that influenced design decisions.
- Brief summary of topology, keywords, wide overview'

###### Executive Summary
- Breakdown what is being offered and for how much
- example:
> Client Company Name has asked Your Company Name to bid on an upcoming network buildout at their new head office. Our proposal includes 228 pairs of tin cans and 6000 feet of category 17 twisted twine to interconnect them, as well as a few pigeons for stringless communications. Total hardware costs are estimated to be $250, with a buffer of $300 in case the lower-cost cat 17 string is not available. Annual upkeep of the pigeons will be $200, plus the time of a co-op student. Installation labour costs for this job are not a factor as Your Company Name will use a government program to employ co-op and newly graduated students, therefore labour costs will be covered. Internet access will cost a total of $7500 in year one, and $4800 on an annual basis. 
> 
> In summary, first-year costs will be $8050. Total annual upkeep should be budgeted at $5000 to include low-cost co-op students for maintenance activities, the pigeons, monthly costs for Internet access, the replacement of rusting tin cans and to accommodate changing office layouts and, of course, new runs of string.

Network IP (without subnetting): 172.20.0.0

12 subnets required, so 4 subnet bits needed

Each dept will have ~2^12 Nodes available

Class B address used as Class C would give too few host adresses per Dept

172.20.			[0000]		0000.0000000
[Default Network)	(subnets)	(host nodes)

Default Subnet Mask: 255.255.0.0
Actual Subnet MAsk: 255.255.240.0

Network Will use NAT to translate private IP addresses into a single public Address

CSLM is used to ensure that each Dept can expand without running out of host nodes

Subnets ranges based on floor number, starting at 1, 
so that if for example (172.20.165.x) has an issue, 
they're probably on the top floor

Multi-Floor depts will need to have their subnet ranges divided more, 
based on which access switch they'll use

All servers will be given Static IP addresses

To the SHANA Networks team,

Thank you for your interest in our RFP. 

We can see that you have a complete team of five staff working on putting together a proposal.  You've noted our size, and the details of the building we are moving into.

We're looking forward to seeing what you come up with!  Please let us know if you have any questions, or if would like to meet regarding the project.

###### Video Discussion Plan
- ~5 min video, simulate quick call with the client (looking for status update on proposal)
- don't need exhaustive detail just the highlights
- "It is 100% okay if this is not the final design"
	- allowed to change it before submitting final proposal and presentation
- don't need to cover EVERY aspect but DO need to cover the following:
	- **Proposed cabling plant choices**
	- **Proposed hardware choices**
	- **Total cost of these elements**
- we will receive full marks if submission is on time, company can understand our presentation and required elements are all included

###### ER/Datacenter locations
- ["i would accept a design that has a containerized data center..."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGqQDDNGC00)
- see Rittal IT containers
- ![[Pasted image 20241114143458.png]]
- edge computing enclosures
	- climate control, power, remote management
		- maybe necessary if we relocate data center to top floor

###### Managed Switches
- CBS110-24 (24 port unmanaged gigabit switch from Cisco)
	- ~$166
- WS-C2960L-24TS-LL (24 port managed gigabit switch from Cisco)
	- ~$1700

Our design follows all TIA/EIA network compliance, some examples include:
-Twisted pair cabling will all use TIA/EIA T568B colour standards
-Cable trays have been approved for backbone cabling
-All MMF fibre wiring is less than 2 Km long
-Horizontal cabling is terminated into a patch panel in the TR
-All horizontal wiring is below the 90 m limit for TO to TR connectivity
-Backbone cabling follows a hierarchal logical star topology, with TRs, EF and servers connecting to the ER

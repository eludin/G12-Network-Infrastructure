###### Notes:
- Each department should be networked with future expansion in mind
	- at least one step higher than required number of ports to accommodate growth
	- will also provide "executives" the connectivity they will require (see below)
	- will also provide space for ap connection
- Assignment brief mentions executives:
	- "...executives without their own offices are accommodated in standard cubicles situated alongside other staff members within their respective departments..."
